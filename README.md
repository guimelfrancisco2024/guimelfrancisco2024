## 🧠 About Me  
As a Reliability Data Analyst, I transform raw manufacturing data into actionable insights to **optimize equipment reliability, operational efficiency, and asset longevity**.  
I combine **data science**, **technical metalwork knowledge**, and **process reliability concepts** to support strategic industrial decisions.

🔧 I'm currently focused on:  
- Performance analysis of industrial machinery  
- Failure pattern detection & root cause analysis (RCA)  
- Preventive maintenance strategies using data  
- Dashboards for OEE and productivity metrics  
- Bridging **technical field knowledge (metalwork)** with **data analytics**

## 🧰 Technical & Industrial Toolset

**Data & Analytics**  
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, numpy)  
- SQL for industrial databases  
- Google Sheets & Excel Automation  
- Power BI  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Statistical modeling for downtime/root cause investigation

**Reliability & Manufacturing Concepts**  
- RCM (Reliability-Centered Maintenance)  
- RCA (Root Cause Analysis)  
- OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness)  
- MTBF / MTTR  
- CMMS data usage  
- Maintenance and production data reporting  
- TPM (Total Productive Maintenance) 

**Technical Background**  
- Experience in metalwork and mechanical operations  
- Manufacturing floor observation & data gathering  
- Understanding of maintenance logs, shift reports, and operational inefficiencies
